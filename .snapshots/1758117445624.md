Project Snapshot

Repo currently on main with a large batch of untracked additions across docs/, examples/, reports/, src/, and temp/; nothing staged or committed yet (git status -sb).
Core README documents TQL as a schema-agnostic EAV+Datalog engine with Bun-based demos and build tooling (README.md:1).
Code Highlights

EAV store provides fact ingestion, multiple indexes, catalog metadata, and stats for downstream analytics (src/eav-engine.ts:1).
Query layer delivers a semi-naive Datalog evaluator with external predicates, negation handling, and working-set management (src/query/datalog-evaluator.ts:1).
New analytics utilities include dataset relationship analysis and an insights engine that can auto-suggest cross-dataset queries (src/analytics/insights-engine.ts:1).
AI orchestration module wraps OpenAI via @ai-sdk, adds intent classification, optional Tree-of-Thought planning, and typed orchestration flows (src/ai/orchestrator.ts:1; docs in docs/TOT-PLANNER.md:1).
CLI tooling (src/cli/tql.ts:1) combines data ingestion (files/URLs), EQL-S parsing, and orchestrated natural-language querying; backup script tql.ts.bak still present.
Graph subsystem now exposes execution engine, validators, and Ink-based logger UI components (src/graph/index.ts:1; src/graph/InkLogger.tsx:1).
Query generation helper suggests EQL-S templates from catalog stats to accelerate exploration (src/query/query-generator.ts:1).
Documentation expanded with analytics guide and URL-sourcing reference (docs/ANALYTICS-README.md:1, docs/URL-SOURCES-GUIDE.md:1).
Sample reports (Mermaid ER diagrams, relationship analyses) and numerous demos illustrate adapters, insights, and visualization flows (reports/er_diagram.mmd:1, examples/insights-engine-demo.ts:1).
Gaps & Risks

No automated tests or CI scripts surfaced; functionality unverified in this pass.
Large number of untracked files suggests work is mid-migration—watch for duplicates (e.g., src/cli/tql.ts vs tql.ts.bak) and ensure exports stay consistent.
src/workflows/ is currently empty; clarify intent or remove to avoid confusion.
OpenAI-driven orchestrator depends on external API keys; network-restricted environments will need mocks or fallbacks.
Next Steps

Curate the untracked additions into logical commits (group by docs, engine upgrades, demos) and prune temporary/back-up artifacts before staging.
Wire new modules into top-level exports or package entry points where appropriate (e.g., ensure analytics/query-gen utilities are discoverable).
Add regression coverage—unit tests for EAVStore, integration smoke tests for CLI and orchestrator with mocked models.
Document operational requirements: API keys, Bun version, demo instructions, and how to run the new analytics/reporting flows.
Evaluate packaging/release strategy (npm/bun) once code stabilizes, including versioning and CLI distribution.

{ Quick actions (copy/paste)
- Inspect changes:
  git status -sb
  git add -N .    # stage changes without content if you want to draft commits
- Commit in logical groups (example):
  git add src/ docs/ examples/
  git commit -m "feat: add engine, CLI, docs (initial import)"
  git add reports/ examples/analytics/
  git commit -m "chore: add reports and demos"
- Remove or relocate backups and temp files:
  git rm --cached tql.ts.bak || true
  rm tql.ts.bak
- Add helpful .gitignore entries (project root):
  # ignore editor, snapshots, backups
  .snapshots/
  *.bak
  *.tmp
- Create a minimal CI (see .github/workflows/ci.yml) to run Bun checks before merging.
- Quick local checks:
  bun --version
  bun run typecheck
  bun run test
}

Recommended .gitignore entries (add to project root):

```
# ignore editor, snapshots, backups
.snapshots/
*.bak
*.tmp
```
