# Feature Specification: [FEATURE NAME]

**Feature Branch**: `[###-feature-name]`  
**Created**: [DATE]  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "$ARGUMENTS"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines for TQL Features
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT data patterns and query needs users have and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no EAV internals, AI model specifics, query optimization details)  
- ÔøΩ Written for domain experts and data analysts, not TQL developers
- üìä Think in terms of entity-attribute-value relationships and cross-domain patterns

### Section Requirements  
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every TQL feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the data processing or query feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation of TQL Specs
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption about data structure, query patterns, or user intent
2. **Don't guess data schemas**: If the prompt doesn't specify entity relationships, attribute types, or query requirements, mark it
3. **Think like a query tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common TQL underspecified areas**:
   - Entity naming conventions and ID strategies
   - Attribute cardinality (one vs many values)
   - Cross-domain query requirements  
   - Natural language query patterns
   - Performance targets for data scale
   - External predicate requirements (regex, comparisons, etc.)
   - AI orchestration complexity needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary Data Processing Story
[Describe the main data ingestion and query journey - what data sources, what questions users want to answer]

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** [data source/format], **When** [user performs query/analysis], **Then** [expected query results and performance]
2. **Given** [entity relationships], **When** [cross-domain query executed], **Then** [expected fact traversal and results]

### Edge Cases for TQL
- What happens when [data format/schema changes]?
- How does system handle [query complexity limits]?
- What about [natural language ambiguity in queries]?
- How are [entity ID conflicts] resolved across data sources?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST [data ingestion capability, e.g., "ingest nested JSON structures as EAV facts"]
- **FR-002**: System MUST [query capability, e.g., "support regex pattern matching in attribute values"]  
- **FR-003**: Users MUST be able to [query interaction, e.g., "query across multiple entity types using natural language"]
- **FR-004**: System MUST [cross-domain requirement, e.g., "apply same query patterns to different data schemas"]
- **FR-005**: System MUST [AI integration, e.g., "convert natural language to structured EQL-S queries"]

*Example of marking unclear TQL requirements:*
- **FR-006**: System MUST handle entity relationships via [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: direct references, nested objects, or separate link facts?]
- **FR-007**: System MUST support external predicates for [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: what domain-specific operations beyond regex/gt/lt?]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **[Entity 1]**: [What it represents, key attributes without implementation]
- **[Entity 2]**: [What it represents, relationships to other entities]
