This tool's ability to ingest and query semi-structured data makes it useful for more than just simple API queries. Here are some unconventional use cases:

### **Log File Analysis**

Instead of using traditional log parsing tools, you could pre-process log files into a JSON-like format where each line is an object with attributes like `timestamp`, `level`, and `message`. TQL could then be used to run complex, ad-hoc queries against terabytes of log data, such as:

-   Finding all **`ERROR`** messages from a specific date range.
-   Identifying the top 10 most frequent warnings or failed requests.
-   Correlating different log events based on a session ID.

### **Automated Web Scraping and Data Exploration**

Many websites expose data in structured HTML tables or hidden JSON payloads. You could write a script to scrape this data and convert it into a local JSON file. TQL can then serve as a powerful data exploration tool, allowing you to quickly query and analyze the scraped data without needing to load it into a full-fledged database. For example:

-   Scraping a list of products from an e-commerce site and then using TQL to find all **products under a certain price**.
-   Extracting and analyzing a sports team's statistics table to find a player with the highest `score` and `assists` combined.

### **Personal Knowledge & Data Management**

A user could maintain a personal knowledge base by storing different types of information in separate JSON files (e.g., one file for notes, another for bookmarks, and a third for contacts). TQL's ability to query a directory of files at once turns this folder into a single, cohesive database. This allows for cross-file queries like:

-   Finding all notes related to "Project Alpha" that also contain a `URL` bookmark.
-   Listing all contacts with a "freelance" tag who were last contacted in the last month.

### **API Gateway / Data-Shaping Layer**

TQL's ability to load from a URL and execute a query makes it a potential lightweight API gateway. A backend service could expose TQL's functionality to clients. Instead of a client making a direct API call and receiving a full, verbose JSON response, they could send a TQL query as part of the request, and the TQL layer would handle the data retrieval and **return a highly tailored response**, similar to how a GraphQL endpoint works. This can reduce payload size and improve client performance.
